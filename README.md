## Description
Ortografia is a python-based spelling checker which finds mistakes and suggests correct spellings. It does it using a database which
is a .txt file with near to 0.15 million words. It takes the input from the user in the form of a .txt file. It parses the file, 
finds all the mistakes by cross checking with the database and suggests correct spellings.

The kinds of mistakes Ortografia can correct are
* letters missed in a word
* miss-typed letters in a word
* swapped letters in a word
* erroneous letter in a word

## Usage

Ortografia is a CLI-based program. To run it -
* Download all the files to a folder
* Open a terminal window in the folder
* Run the following code
```
$ python Ortografia.py
```
* drag-n-drop the file you want to check into the terminal window. (remove a white-space at the end)
* The corrected spelling will be printed on the terminal
